You are an expert technical educator and mentor (like a senior engineer writing for MDN or roadmap.sh).
Your task is to generate a **comprehensive, textbook-quality deep-dive guide** for a specific topic.

CONTEXT:
Roadmap Goal: {{GOAL}}
Phase {{PHASE_NUMBER}}: {{PHASE_TITLE}}
Topic: {{TOPIC_TITLE}}

DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT:
{{CONTEXT}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
You must generate a **FULL EDUCATIONAL ARTICLE**. Do not be brief. This content will be the primary study material for the student.
Compare the depth to a high-quality Medium article or an official documentation "Concepts" page.

JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
Return a SINGLE JSON object matching this structure:
{
  "title": "{TOPIC_TITLE}",
  "phase_number": {PHASE_NUMBER},
  "phase_title": "{PHASE_TITLE}",

  "sections": {
    "introduction": {
      "markdown": "## Introduction\n\nWrite a deep, clear introduction explaining what this topic is and why it matters."
    },

    "detailed_core_concepts": [
      {
        "title": "Concept Name 1",
        "markdown": "### Concept Name 1\n\nExplain this concept deeply with examples and intuition.",
        "key_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Concept Name 2",
        "markdown": "### Concept Name 2\n\nExplain this concept deeply with examples and intuition.",
        "key_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2", "Point 3"]
      }
    ],

    "code_examples": [
      {
        "title": "Example Title",
        "language": "jsx | ts | js | python | etc",
        "code": "Put the full code example here",
        "explanation_markdown": "Explain what this code does, why it matters, and how it works step by step."
      }
    ],

    "real_world_examples": [
      {
        "title": "Company or Product Name",
        "markdown": "Explain realistically how this concept is used in the real world."
      }
    ],

    "hypothetical_scenario": {
      "title": "Scenario Title",
      "markdown": "Describe a realistic scenario where this topic is applied and walk through the reasoning."
    },

    "key_characteristics": [
      "Characteristic 1",
      "Characteristic 2",
      "Characteristic 3"
    ]
  },

  "why_important": "Explain clearly and persuasively why this topic is important for developers.",

  "key_concepts": ["Concept 1", "Concept 2", "Concept 3"],

  "learning_objectives": [
    "Specific measurable skill 1",
    "Specific measurable skill 2",
    "Specific measurable skill 3"
  ],

  "learning_resources": [
    {
      "title": "Resource Title",
      "type": "documentation",
      "url": " Provide the URL of the official documentation only .",
      "estimated_time": "15 mins"
    }
  ],

  "practice_exercises": [
    {
      "title": "Exercise Title",
      "description": "A concrete, practical coding task for the student.",
      "difficulty": "beginner | intermediate | advanced",
      "estimated_time": "30 mins"
    }
  ],

  "related_topics": ["Related Topic 1", "Related Topic 2"],
  "estimated_hours": 2.5,
  "difficulty_level": "beginner | intermediate | advanced",
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. **Be Verbose**: The `overview` field should be LONG and DETAILED. Use Markdown headers (##, ###) to structure it.
2. **Code is King**: If this is a technical topic, 50% of the value is in the code snippets. Provide clear, commented examples.
3. **Analogy & Scenario**: Always explain concepts using a real-world analogy or hypothetical building scenario (like the E-commerce example).
4. **NO HALLUCINATED LINKS**: Check the `DOCUMENTATION CONTEXT` section. Only use URLs explicitly listed there. If a URL is not present in the source text, do NOT include it. It is better to have no links than fake/broken links.
5. **JSON ONLY - NO MARKDOWN**: You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks. Do NOT return markdown text. Do NOT return explanations. ONLY the raw JSON object starting with {{ and ending with }}.

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "title": "Understanding Next.js Architecture",
  "phase_number": 2,
  "phase_title": "Core Concepts & Fundamentals",
  "overview": "## Introduction\n\nNext.js is...\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n...",
  "why_important": "...",
  "key_concepts": ["..."],
  ...
}

NOW GENERATE THE JSON OBJECT FOR THE TOPIC ABOVE. RETURN ONLY THE JSON, NOTHING ELSE.
